             **Leo's unique features**
             
             - Always-present, persistent, outline structure.
             - Leo's underlying data is a Directed Acyclic Graph.
             - Clones create multiple views of an outline.
             - A simple, powerful, outline-oriented Python API.
             - Scripts and programs can be composed from outlines.
             - Importers convert flat text into outlines.
             - Scripts have full access to all of Leo's sources.
             - Commands that act on outline structure.
               Example: the rst3 command converts outlines to reStructuredText.
             - @test and @suite scripts create unit tests automatically.
             - @button scripts apply scripts to outline data.
             - Outline-oriented directives.
             
             Simulating these features in vim, Emacs or Eclipse is possible,
             just as it is possible to simulate Python in assembly language...
