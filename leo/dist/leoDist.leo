Description: Leo is:

             - An outliner. Everything in Leo is an outline.
             - A Personal Information Manager.
             - A browser with a memory.
             - A powerful scripting environment.
             - A tool for studying other people's code.
             - A fully-featured IDE, with emacs-like commands.
             - Extensible via a simple plugin architecture.
             - A tool that plays well with  IPython, vim and xemacs.
             - Written in 100% pure Python
             - Compatible with Python 2.6 and above or Python 3.0 and above.
             - A tool with an inspiring and active community.
             
             **Leo's unique features**
             
             - Always-present, persistent, outline structure.
             - Leo's underlying data is a Directed Acyclic Graph.
             - Clones create multiple views of an outline.
             - A simple, powerful, outline-oriented Python API.
             - Scripts and programs can be composed from outlines.
             - Importers convert flat text into outlines.
             - Scripts have full access to all of Leo's sources.
             - Commands that act on outline structure.
               Example: the rst3 command converts outlines to reStructuredText.
             - @test and @suite scripts create unit tests automatically.
             - @button scripts apply scripts to outline data.
             - Outline-oriented directives.
             
             Simulating these features in vim, Emacs or Eclipse is possible,
             just as it is possible to simulate Python in assembly language...

<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.3">I like Leo more the more I use it...It's an unexpected pleasure to
see my (linearly written) code outlined in Leo. I can't wait to use
Leo to start a new project, going from outline to code...Thanks again
for providing the computing community with such a fine piece of
software. -- Jim Shapiro, Ph.D.

If you think you have used all possible programmer's editors, but
have not yet tried Leo, you are wrong...I rate Leo as a "must have"
for Python programmers. The code makes for a good read.
-- John Tobler  http://weblogs.asp.net/Jtobler/
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.4">I've written documentation in WordPerfert, Ventura, Word, PageMaker, and
FrameMaker and even though they create wonderfully looking and useful
documents, they've never been able to do what I've been looking for. HTML,
compiled help files, and later PDF came closer, but still not there. I think
I've found it in LEO, a way to make a "living" document. A document built out
of discrete parts that can be re-organized on the fly to meet the needs of a
varying audience...Being a convert for less than a day I've still got a lot to
learn, but just the possibility of keeping system maintenance scripts in the IT
manual is mind boggling.  -- David Nichols dnichols@amci.com</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040630210818">HTML Editing in Leo is soooo much easier then with NoNodeEditors. Ive
had a blast working on a web page. Usually I had to look at a bunch of
gunk all at once. Now I can look at little pieces of gunk! :) 

-Anon (for now)

Before leo, I try to avoid or refactor long functions. With leo, I am
very tempted not to. Being able to view and slice my code at a higher
level in pretty much anyway I want, I feel like a commanding master in
my own mess...Leo lets me be lazy and get away with it. ;)

Mark Ng

[Quote] I have just finished a little embedded system for someone, written in
C using leo as the editor. I told the customer he _had_ to use leo for
ongoing maintenance, after I looked at one of the main state machines:
600 lines in the derived file, but trivialy easy to get your head
around in Leo...

The good news is that having been forced to meet leo he thinks it'll
solve many other problems that his company has with code maintenance.
Another step to world domination!

Leo allows you to do things that you'd never consider with another editor. 

BTW: in a real-time embedded system like I was working on, not having
the overhead of a function call (which you'd have had if you'd split
the case statement as you would with a normal editor) saves time, and
makes the system more flexible...

<t tx="ekr.20040828084148">Leo is the best IDE that I have had the pleasure to use. I have been using it
now for about 2 -- 3 months. It has totally changed not only the way that I
program, but also the way that I store and organise all of the information that
I need for the job that I do. -- Ian Mulvany</t>

socks off that Java Mind mapping software that won project of the month a while
back on sourceforge!" -- Derick van Niekerk.

<t tx="ekr.20060823090437">Thanks for creating the most useful and amazing application that
I've come across in years. I use Leo every day.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070101093904">Leo is THE BEST THING to ever had happened to me. I've done in two

<t tx="ekr.20070425092712">Leo--especially with its feature of user-controllable outlining and
overview __has for the last 4-5 years had the greatest positive effect

in the software world (apart maybe from the Python language itself,
and those who contribute Python modules to the world). -- David McNab

Leo 4.8 final is now available at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://leoeditor.com/

The highlights of Leo 4.8:
--------------------------

- Leo now uses the simplest possible sentinel lines in external files.
  External files with sentinels now look like Emacs org-mode files.
- Leo Qt gui now supports Drag and Drop.
  This was one of the most frequently requested features.
- Improved abbreviation commands.
  You now define abbreviations in Leo settings nodes, not external files.
- @url nodes may contain url's in body text.
  This allows headlines to contain summaries: very useful.
- Leo now uses PyEnchant to check spelling.
- Leo can now open multiple files from the command line.
- Leo's ancient Tangle and Untangle commands are now deprecated.
  This will help newbies how to learn Leo.
- Leo now shows "Resurrected" and "Recovered" nodes.
  These protect data and show how data have changed.
  These fix several long-standing data-related problems.
- A new "screenshots" plugin for creating slide shows with Leo.
  I used this plugin to create Leo's introductory slide shows.
- Improved autocompletion: Ctrl-space starts a one-time completion.
- A better installer.
- Many bug fixes.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more.
See: http://leoeditor.com/

The highlights of Leo 4.9:
--------------------------

- The Qt gui completely replaces the Tk gui--Qt gui now has all essential
  features of Tk, including plugins.

- Completed Leo's autocompleter.

- The rendering pane can now display movies, html, svg images, etc.

- The scrolledmessage plugin can now use the rendering pane.

- Nodes may contain multiple @language directives.

- Leo highlights URL's everywhere. Ctrl-click URL's opens them in your web
  browser. 

- Leo uses an @file node's extension by default if there is no @language
  directive in effect.
  
- Unified extract and import commands.

- Leo can now colorize multiple @language directives in a single node.

- Plain up/down arrow keys in headline-editing mode select a new node.

- New commands to insert, delete, change or print uA's.

- Added namespace directive to .leo files.

- Fixed many bugs, some important, most quite minor.

Leo 4.10 final is now available at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more.
http://leoeditor.com/

Leo 4.10 contains 9 months of intense work on Leo. Several very important
features are subtle; you could almost call them Easter Eggs, so please read
the following notes carefully.

The highlights of Leo 4.10:
--------------------------

* Dozens of new and improved features and commands, including...
  - Tab completion now shows all @command &amp; @button nodes.
  - Leo tabs may be detached from the main window.
  - The Open With menu now works.
  - The leoInspect module answers questions about Python code.
  - Leo can highlight the pane containing the focus.
  - The bigdash plugin searches across multiple files.
  - Improved abbreviation capabilities.
  - Improved handling of URL's.
  - Improved editing of non-Leo files.
  - Improvements create "weightless" unit testing.
  - Improved Leo's home page.
* Easier installation on MacOS.
* Fixed almost 70 bugs.

The Easter Eggs
---------------

1. Tab completion now shows all @command &amp; @button nodes.

Put all your common scripts in @command nodes in myLeoSettings.leo.
Typing &lt;Alt-X&gt;@c&lt;Tab&gt; will remind you of the names of these scripts.
You can execute the scripts by name without the "@command-" prefix.

2. Improved abbreviation capabilities.

Virtually any kind of abbreviation is possible. For example, ~a to ã.

3. Improved handling of URL's.

URL's can be used as links to other Leo outlines.

4 Weightless unit testing.

The mantra is edit, alt-4 (run-marked-unit-tests-externally), edit,
alt-4,... Several seemingly innocuous changes made this work without
"friction". The result is a remarkable increase in productivity.

<t tx="ekr.20130809141000.1991">System requirements
-------------------

Leo requires the `Python`_ and `PyQt_` package.
The `PyEnchant`_ package is optional. 

**Python**: Leo will work on any platform that supports Python 2.6 or
above, including Python 3.0 and above. To install Python, see
http://python.org.

**PyQt**: PyQt provides Leo's widgets. To install PyQt, get the binary
package from: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
The PyQt version must match your installed Python version. Remember that
Leo requires Python 2.6 or later, or Python 3.0 or later. Now run the
binary PyQt installer.

**PyEnchant**: You must install the PyEnchant package if you want to use
Leo's Spell tab. Download and install the PyEnchant package from
http://pythonhosted.org/pyenchant/download.html There is an executable
installer for Windows users.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130809141000.1992">
Leo's HOME directory
--------------------

Python's HOME environment variable specifies Leo's HOME directory.
See http://docs.python.org/lib/os-procinfo.html for details.

Leo puts several files in your HOME/.leo directory:
.leoID.txt, .leoRecentFiles.txt, and myLeoSettings.leo.
There are various fallback directories if there is no home directory.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130809141000.1993">
Installing Leo on Linux
-----------------------

You may download Leo's sources in one of three ways, as described at:
http://leoeditor.com/download.html If the sources are zipped, unzip them
into a folder in your home directory, say ~/leo-5.2 (or /usr/bin, etc.)

To gain access to Leo, you have two choices:

A. Add  ~/leo-5.2 to your path.
B. Create alias for Leo.

I prefer using aliases because they allow me to start Leo using Python 2 or 3,
or other distributions, like Anaconda 2 or 3.

See `Running Leo`_ for how to run Leo after installing it.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130809141000.1994">
Installing Leo on Windows
--------------------------

Install Python and Qt, as described above.

Now you have a choice.  You can use Leo's binary (single-click) installer
or download Leo's sources directly.

1. Using the single-click installer

Leo has a binary installer for Windows, available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/ The binary installer
installs Leo and sets Windows file associations.

2. Installing from sources

You may download Leo's sources in one of three ways, as described at:
http://leoeditor.com/download.html If the sources are zipped, unpack them
into a temp folder. You may place the sources anywhere you like, including
Python's *site-packages* folder, for example,
C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130809141000.1995">
Running Leo
-----------

You can run Leo from a Python interpreter as follows::

    import leo
    leo.run() # runs Leo, opening a new outline or,
    leo.run(fileName=aFileName) # runs Leo, opening the given file name.

Another way to run Leo is as follows::

    cd &lt;path-to-launchLeo.py&gt;
    python launchLeo.py
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130809141000.1996">
Creating File Associations
--------------------------

**Linux**

The following shell script will allow you to open foo.leo files by typing leo foo::

    #!/bin/sh 
    python &lt;leopath&gt;launchLeo.py $1

where &lt;leopath&gt; is the path to the directory *containing* the leo directory. 

**Windows**

*Important*: Leo's binary Windows installer sets file associations
automatically, so this section is needed only if you are installing Leo
from a .zip file or other sources.

There are two ways of associating .leo files with Leo. The first uses the
Windows control panel, the second, the Windows console.

**Method 1: Using the Windows Control Panel**

The goal is that you want to associate .leo files with the following command::

    "&lt;path to python&gt;\python.exe" "&lt;path to launchLeo.py&gt;\launchLeo.py" "%1"
    
Before Windows 7, you do this with using the Folder Options control panel.
In Windows 7, you do this with the Default Programs control panel.

*Note*: "%1" passes just the file being clicked on, quoted for spaces etc.
The quotation marks are needed to handle file paths containing spaces.

*Warning:* In a batch file, %1 passes just the first command line parameter.
It is logical to expect %* to work for file associations just as in batch
files. Alas, it does not.

**Method 2: Using the Windows Console**

Open a Windows console with administrator privileges, then type::

    ftype LeoFile="&lt;path to python&gt;\pythonw.exe" "&lt;path to launchLeo.py&gt;\launchLeo.py" "%1" %*
    assoc .leo=LeoFile

And put this leo.bat in %PATH%::

    @start /b "Leo" "&lt;path to python&gt;\python.exe" "&lt;path to launchLeo.py&gt;\launchLeo.py" %*
    
You may omit the /b option if you want to create a separate console window for Leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130809141000.1997">
Adding Leo to Your Path
-----------------------

After you have installed Leo, you should add the location of your leo/core folder to your python path.
One way to do this is adding something like the following to python/Lib/sitecustomize.py:

    import sys
    sys.path.append(r'&lt;path-to-leo&gt;leo\core')

Another way is to append &lt;path-to-leo&gt; to the Windows PYTHONPATH environment variable.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20130809141000.1998">
Running Leo for the first time
------------------------------

The first time you start Leo, a dialog will ask you for a unique identifier. If
you are using cvs, use your cvs login name. Otherwise your initials will do. Leo
stores this identifier in the file ``.leoID.txt``. Leo attempts to create
``leoID.txt`` in the .leo sub-directory of your home directory, then in Leo's config directory, and
finally in Leo's core directory. You can change this identifier at any time by
editing ``.leoID.txt``.

&gt; python setup.py sdist upload

This is the tricky part, there's a bunch of prep-work that's hidden,
involving getting a properly formatted ~/.pypirc. It looks very
straightforward, according to docs, but in practice I've found devilishly
difficult. There are bugs lurking in distutils/setuptools/something. I've
had my .pypirc mangled by "register" and had to rebuild manually. Anyway:

Step 1:
python setup.py register

and answer wizard steps, you'll need your pypi user and pass handy.
DO save at end.

Step 2: manually edit %HOME%\.pypirc and make sure it resembles below.
**Do not** use https.

Step 3: the commands in previous message (`python setup.py sdist upload`)

Here's my .pypirc:

[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
    testpypi

[pypi]
repository: http://pypi.python.org/pypi
username: {{omitted}}
password: {{omitted}}

[testpypi]
repository: http://testpypi.python.org/pypi
username: {{omitted}}
password: {{omitted}}

It really is a horrible system. The user and pass are sent in clear text. I
don't know what's taking them so long to use SSH keys or OpenID or..., but
frankly it's to Python's detriment. I hope they get it sorted out sooner
than later.

[Leo](http://leoeditor.com/) 5.1 final is now available [at SourceForge.](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/) Leo is a PIM, an IDE and an outliner.

Leo 5.1-final is recommended for anyone using Leo 5.1 b1 or Leo 5.0-final.

**The highlights of Leo 5.1**

This release features **@clean** trees, one of the most important developments in Leo's history.

@clean nodes create external files without sentinel comments, yet Leo can update @clean trees from changes made to the corresponding external files, something long thought impossible. @clean trees preserve clone links and user attributes (uA's). Reading @clean trees is faster than reading @auto or @shadow trees. Steve Zatz [explains why @clean changes everything.](http://leoeditor.com/testimonials.html#steve-zatz-explains-why-clean-changes-everything)

**More highlights**
 
* A new [web page](http://leoeditor.com/load-leo.html) displays .leo files in the browser.
  
* Added **command history** to Leo's minibuffer.

* A new IdleTime class greatly simplifies idle-time handling.

* Leo now honors @language inside @doc parts

* @data nodes can be composed of their descendant nodes.

* @shadow is now deprecated. @clean is superior to @shadow in all respects. 

**Links**

The [Mulder/Ream algorithm](http://leoeditor.com/appendices.html#the-mulder-ream-update-algorithm) updates @clean trees from changes made in the corresponding external files.

Python itself, PyQt, pylint and other packages. It also contains many data
files, including Leo's source code and various .leo files.

Notes:

1. leo.exe was created by PyInstaller: http://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller

2. Before Leo starts, PyInstaller unpacks all libraries and data files to a
   temp folder: ~\AppData\Local\Temp\_MEInnn. As a result, starting leo.exe
   is slower than usual.

3. *Warning*: You can open Leo files from the "Files:Open Leo File" menu,
   but these files will be in the temp folder. They will be *destroyed*
   when you exit leo.exe. If you want to do real work with Leo you must

Leo now warns in the log pane and raises a summary dialog about possibly already-open files.  However, all files are opened as usual, leaving it to the user to determine what to do.

A (new?) bug *won't* be fixed.  Closing a file removes the file's entry from g.app.db, so reopening the file *again* won't give another warning.  This is a very minor matter.

What I did: (See app.Detecting already-open files)

The fix was so simple: just use default arguments to connect_qtconsole.

The preliminaries were at least as important as the fix itself:

1. Modernized the imports, removing support for legacy imports. Imo, it would be unwise to support ancient code now.

2. Added logging methods. This makes it possible to understand and debug the code in leoIPython.py. Furthermore...

3. Leo's --debug option enables more verbose IPython logging. This is a feature that reveals the workings of the Jupyter kernel.

Rev 585d2f4 improves abbreviations as follows:

- Match longest prefix first: e;; no longer interferes with date;;
- Predefine 'x' as the empty string before executing abbreviation scripts.
- Split @data abbreviations-subst-env into separate nodes.
- Defined do() and insert() functions in @data abbreviations-subst-env as follows::

**Note**:  Because of a glitch in how abbreviations scripts are created, this won't work::

    do(['command1','command2'])

even though c.k.simulateCommand allows list arguments.  Instead, do this::

    do('command1');do('command2');

The following abbreviations insert matching characters (no need to do x='' in them)::

    (={|{insert('()');do('back-char')}|}
    [={|{insert('[]');do('back-char')}|}
    {={|{insert('{}');do('back-char')}|}

This is an implementation of auto-close-quotes, done entirely with abbreviations! For example, typing '(' inserts '()' and puts the cursor between the parens.

I personally dislike these abbreviations.  I find it harder to skip past the ')' than to type it later.  ymmv.

https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues/153

This problem is discussed in the Leo-Editor forum thread:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/leo-editor/3PPObn4JRik

I can't reliably reproduce this problem, so I can't give you a test case that demonstrates it.

The symptom that I first noticed was unexpected, unpredictable changes in what the tree pane showed when I switched back to Leo-Editor after switching away from Leo-Editor by executing open-url.

Sometimes the node selected was unchanged, but it had been scrolled up in the tree pane; and sometimes it had been scrolled all the way out of the tree pane.

Sometimes the node selected had been changed to a sibling node after the node that was selected when I switched away from Leo-Editor.

In all cases, the body pane correctly showed the contents of the currently selected node.

Sometimes an Alt-F4 when a non-Leo-Editor window is the only window showing, causes Leo-Editor to exit or display its "Save changes before exit?" query.

Edward K. Ream currently believes: "The culprit is likely a delayed action (on the order of 0.5 sec) that Leo takes on focus-in events. If the user responds to a focus-in event before that time there will be problems."

My test system:

Xubuntu32 12.04
Python 2.7.3, PyQt version 4.8.1

The problem has been observed on Leo-Editor commit f6cdb2b. It seems to occur slightly more frequently on more recent commits such as 42a5207.

<t tx="ekr.20160314155002.40">​Recent revs add the following new position methods:

- p.is_at_all():  True if p is an @&lt;file&gt; node containing an @all directive.
- p.in_at_all(): True if p is in an @&lt;file&gt; tree whose root contains @all.
- p.is_at_ignore(): True if p is an @ignore node
- p.in_at_ignore_tree(): True if p is in an @ignore tree.

These predicates make it easy to create other predicates that skip @ignore trees or @&lt;file&gt; trees containing @all.  cffm and cfam do not skip such trees, on the theory that one would typically unmark nodes first before marking nodes to be cloned.

So here is how to gather only those marked nodes that lie outside any @ignore tree:

    def isMarked(p):
        return p.isMarked() and not p.in_at_ignore_tree()

    self.cloneFindByPredicate(
        generator = self.all_unique_positions,

<t tx="ekr.20160314155002.43">April 15, 2015

Rev 419a82d changes several aspects of how Leo handles the so-called orphan bit in vnodes.  These are major changes, but I believe they will be for the best.

The orphan bit indicates that there was a problem writing an @&lt;file&gt; node.  It will be set, for example, when an @file node contains children but has no @others directive.  Leo simply cannot write the external file in that case.

However, Leo went overboard with the error logic. Here are the recent changes:

1. Leo no longer writes the orphan bit ('O' bit in vnode attr) in .leo files. This kind of persistent error bit seems unwise.

2. Leo clears the bit and issues a warning when reading a vnode with the 'O' attr.

Previously, Leo would refuse to update the outline from the external file if the orphan bit was set! 

This change could have unforeseen consequences, but I suspect nobody will ever notice.  The foreseen consequence is that Leo will keep the outline and external files in sync more often.

<t tx="ekr.20160314155002.51">Rev 38db98ff improves Leo's existing clone-find commands:

- cff (clone-find-flattened)
- cfa (clone-find-all)

in the following important ways:

1. These commands search the entire outline, regardless of the presently selected node. This is a *huge* improvement--you can start searches anywhere. These commands do honor suboutline-only searches.

2. These commands ignore @ignore trees and any @&lt;file&gt; tree whose root nodes contains an @all directive. No more false matches about nodes in the attic.

3. These commands are significantly faster than before because they search body text in one step.

4. The new command names are short enough that they don't need either key bindings or pre-loaded entries in command history.


These commands are so convenient that they become *temporary*. No need to keep them around. I usually start searches with them instead of Ctrl-F. After I create the clone-find node, I then use Ctrl-F (with the existing find pattern) to search the clone-find results.

This is the pattern I have been looking for. I'm not looking for anything better. Notice, it no longer matters how many clones there are.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20160314155002.52">Two commands that revolutionize my workflow:

- cffm, aka clone-find-flattened-marked
- cfam, aka clone-find-all-marked

These commands create a "target" node as the last top-level node, and clone all marked nodes under the target node.  cffm makes each marked node a child of the target. cfam does not create a child for marked nodes that are descendants of a marked node.

This makes gathering nodes a snap. Just go through the outline, marking the desired nodes, then execute cfam or cffm.  I prefer cffm because all found nodes appear as direct children of the target. These two commands are much better than auto-moving clones as they are made, as I had intended to do yesterday.

Leo's clone-find and clone-find-marked commands allow me to quickly gather desired nodes without duplicates, *regardless* of how many clones there are in an outline. These commands are the magic bullets for searching that I have wanted for decades.

Please try these commands. They are extremely useful.

<t tx="ekr.20160314155002.53"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20160314155002.54">This command does the following:

<t tx="ekr.20160314155002.57">Leo now supports find-def and find-var commands.  They find the definitions of classes, defs or vars. These commands work as follows:

- Select the word at the cursor, if text is not already selected.
- Save the find settings in effect before the command started.
- find-def sets the search pattern to "class word" or "def word"
  depending on whether word is capitalized.
- find-var sets the search pattern to "word =".
- Set word-find to True
- Start the search at the root position of the outline.

This finds the first definition of the word.  Thereafter, you can use F3 (find-next) to find additional definitions.

When the search fails, Leo restores the Find settings to what they were previously.

The new @bool find-ignore-duplicates setting (default False), controls whether any search command ignores duplicate matches.  Ctrl-F restarts searches, clearing a list of vnodes that have already been seen.  Any failed search also clears the list of vnodes.

2. Move the tree so it is the last top-level node under @settings.
3. Remove the @ignore from the copy of this node.
4. Enable one of the three themes below by removing @ignore for its node.
5. Test by opening another Leo outline.

Important Notes

1. The "Themes" node does not define @data qt-gui-plugin-style-sheet.

Instead the new themes machinery uses the so-called "fully parameterized" stylesheet that we have all been using for at least several months now.  This stylesheet is defined as a descendant of the "Appearance" node.

2. The only functional theme is a new ekr_dark theme.  It illustrates how to use the new themes machinery.

- This theme uses a small, custom @data qt-gui-user-style-sheet that adjust colors around outline indicators.

- There is a tree call "Common to all themes" which contains settings that probably can be shared by most themes.  Naturally, setting in that tree can be overridden as you desire.

3. The new themes machinery is supposed to be completely self contained.  That is, there should be no need to use a script to generate a theme.

Yes, the user must fill in all appearance-related settings.  But most users will already have done this, so adjusting the settings for a theme should be straightforward.

4. The "Common to all themes" node contains an "Outline indicators" node that specifies a relative path to outline indicator icons (arrow icons or plus/minus) icons.  The path can be relative to either the users home directory or (as shown in leoSettings.leo) relative to the leo/Icons directory.

After a find command completes (successfully or not), the status areas shows:

- Whether the find command completed successfully.
- The find options in effect for the search.

Previously, the status line was only updated for unsuccessful searches, and it did not contain the find options in effect.  The new status line is much more helpful than the old.

By default, Leo reports successful searches with white text on a blue background and failed searches with white text on a red background. These colors work pretty well even for dark themes.

You can choose these colors using the following settings:

     @color find-found-bg = blue
     @color find-found-fg = white
     @color find-not-found-bg = red
     @color find-not-found-fg = white

There's now an "Edit settings" menu under the main Settings menu, containing many submenus.  Each menu item finds the appropriate setting and copies it to
the appropriate outline for you, so knowing what to look for and how to
manage it is handled.

Sometimes you'll see this dialog:

    The relevant setting, '@bookmarks_base_color', is using the value of
    a more general setting, '@text-foreground'.  Would you like to edit
    the more specific setting, '@bookmarks_base_color', or the more
    general setting, '@text-foreground'?  The more general setting may
    alter appearance / behavior in more places, which may or may not be
    what you prefer.

                            Edit specific   Edit general   Cancel

Wordy, but easy enough to follow.  I guess everything after the
last comma could be deleted :-)

If the setting is in leoSettings.leo, you see:

    The setting '@body-font-family' is in the Leo global configuration
    file 'leoSettings.leo' and should probably be copied to
    'myLeoSettings.leo' before editing.
    It may make more sense to copy a group or category of settings.

    Please enter 1, 2, 3, or 4:
    1. copy the one setting, '@body-font-family'
    2. copy the setting group, 'Body font' (Recommended)
    3. copy the setting whole category, 'Fonts'
    4. edit the setting in 'leoSettings.leo' anyway

Again, wordy, but I think easy enough to understand.

(Having to enter a number to pick an option is clunky, a
 gui-independent 'pick item from list widget' can be added to Leo, I
 just didn't want to mix that task into the current task.)

Note "Reload settings" isn't working as effectively as I think it
should, that may need to be addressed as well.  Unrelated to the new
code.

So, this isn't a silver bullet for the newbie setting editing woes, but
it does eliminate a lot of the Leo specific knowledge required (apart
from "edit a headline").  Also this new approach can be developed
further based on feedback, just wanted to get what I had so far into
the main branch for testing etc.

Terry Brown: I've added remote code execution abilities to mod_http.py  Relevant part of the doc.s pasted below.

This is a plus for a couple of reasons - previously you had to use the leoremote plug-in which used sockets and was really python only, this new approach just uses HTTP GET requests which can be generated by almost anything (language, link in a doc., browser bookmark, etc.). Also leoremote doesn't work in Python 3.x.

This code to load a file into Leo from the command line:
https://github.com/leo-editor/snippets/blob/master/utils/led.py

Can be replaced with this version:
https://github.com/leo-editor/snippets/blob/master/utils/led.sh

Executing code remotely
-----------------------

.. warning::

    Allowing remote code execution is a **HUGE SECURITY HOLE**, you need to be sure that the url from which you access Leo (typically http://localhost:8130/) is accessible only by people and software you trust.

    Remote execution is turned off by default, you need to manually / locally change the @setting ``@bool http_allow_remote_exec = False`` to ``True`` to enable it.

Commands to be executed are submitted via HTTP GET requests, which can be generated in almost any language and also triggered from shortcuts, links in other documents or applications, etc. etc.

The basic form is::

    http://localhost:8130/_/exec/?cmd=&lt;python code for Leo to execute&gt;

The query parameters are:

``cmd`` (required)
    A valid python snippet for Leo to execute.  Executed by the ``vs-eval`` command in the ``valuespace`` plug-in.  Can be specified multiple times, each is executed in order.  May contain newlines, see examples.
    
``c`` (optional)
    Which currently loaded outline to use, can be an integer, starting from zero, or the full path+filename, or just the base filename. Defaults to 0 (zero), i.e. the "first" open outline.
    
``enc`` (optional)
    Encoding for response, 'str', 'repr', or 'json'.  Used to render the returned value.
    
``mime_type`` (optional)
    Defaults to ``text/plain``.  Could be useful to use ``text/html`` etc.

A special variant url is::

    http://localhost:8130/_/exec/commanders/

which returns a list of open outlines.

Examples
========

This command::

    curl http://localhost:8130/_/exec/?cmd='c.bringToFront()' &gt;/dev/null

will raise the Leo window, or at least make the window manager signal the
need to raise it.

::

    curl --get --data-urlencode \
      cmd='g.handleUrl("file:///home/tbrown/.leo/.contacts.leo#Contacts", c)' \
      http://localhost:8130/_/exec/ &gt;/dev/null

will cause a running Leo instance to open ``/some/path/contacts.leo`` and select the ``Contacts`` node.  A desktop icon link, browser bookmark, or link in a spread-sheet or other document could be used the same way.

In the ``bash`` shell language, this code::

    TEXT="$@"
    curl --silent --show-error --get --data-urlencode cmd="
        nd = c.rootPosition().insertAfter()
        nd.h = 'TODO: $TEXT'
        import time
        nd.b = '# created %s' % time.asctime()
        c.selectPosition(nd)
        c.redraw()
        'To do item created\n'
    " http://localhost:8130/_/exec/

could be written in a file called ``td``, and then, assuming that file is executable and on the shell's path, entering::

    td remember to vacuum the cat

on the command line would create a node at the top of the first open outline in Leo with a headline ``TODO: remember to vacuum the cat`` and a body text ``# created Wed Jul 29 16:42:26 2015``. The command ``vs-eval`` returns the value of the last expression in a block, so the trailing ``'To do item created\n'`` gives better feedback than ``None`` generated by ``c.redraw()``. ``c.selectPosition(nd)`` is important ant to stop Leo getting confused about which node is selected.

<t tx="ekr.20160314155002.91">If you aren't using the @data history-list setting chances are that you missing a big chance to simplify your workflow. At one time I thought the history list was a minor feature.  I could not have been more wrong.

The body of the @data history-list node should contain a list of command names, one per line.  This list can include commands created by @command/@button nodes.

You execute items in the history list by doing Alt-X followed by an up arrow to get the first item in the list, or one or more down arrows to get later items in the list.  The last item you execute from this list goes to the head of the list.  Once you have executed an item, Ctrl-P (repeat complex command) will re-execute it.

The history list works well for commands that aren't quite worth a separate key binding, but that nevertheless you find you using quite often.

Even better, the history list is a perfect complement to @button and @command nodes that are tailored for a particular outline. For example, there is a button called cfa-code in leoPy.leo that executes the clone-find-all-flattened command starting at the top-level "Code" node.

It would be tricky, and not terribly useful, to fold this user stylesheet into

Also, the default settings aren't bad, but I prefer to change qt-gui-user-style-sheet directly.

[Leo](http://leoeditor.com/) 5.3-final is now available on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/). Leo is a PIM, an IDE and an outliner.

**The highlights of Leo 5.3**

- Leo now supports Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files.
- @chapter is now allowed anywhere. No need for @chapters.
- Faster spell checking.
- The rst3 command supports @rst-table.
- The show-invisibles command now uses native Qt characters.
- Dozens of other improvements and bug fixes.

**Leo is**:

- An outliner. Everything in Leo is an outline.
- A Personal Information Manager.
- A browser with a memory.
- A powerful scripting environment.
- A tool for studying other people's code.
- A fully-featured IDE, with emacs-like commands.
- Extensible via a simple plugin architecture.
- A tool that plays well with  IPython, vim and xemacs.
- Written in 100% pure Python
- Compatible with Python 2.6 and above or Python 3.0 and above.
- A tool with an inspiring and active community.

**Leo's unique features**:
    
- Always-present, persistent, outline structure.
- Leo's underlying data is a Directed Acyclic Graph.
- Clones create multiple views of an outline.
- A simple, powerful, outline-oriented Python API.
- Scripts and programs can be composed from outlines.
- Importers convert flat text into outlines.
